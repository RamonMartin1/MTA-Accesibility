**Project description:** For those with mobility issues, non-ADA compliant NYC subway stations pose as both a danger and an extra financial burden. Falls are an unfortunate possibility, and the inability to use the subway can leave to more expensive transportation options.

Our plan is to combine MTA turnstile data with demographic information from the 2018 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) estimates to identify which 5 subway stations would most benefit from elevator installation.
